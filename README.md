### Documentation

I use [puppeeter](https://devdocs.io/puppeteer/) and [brightdata](https://brightdata.com) to scrape data.

Go to this [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo_fUjb02ns) to claim $10 dollar for scraping data and see the tutorial.

Feel free to change and commit

**How to run this program**
Claim the free tier for bright data, use your ID and passwork given by this service to change in `index.js`.
Please do not change the `csv` data, scrape to different filename before commit to avoid overwritten.

`npm install`
Then
`node index.js`

Make sure to have node and npm install in your machine.
